# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 10th May 2020, Sunday

*Note: Today technically counts as a missed day, as its the first im gonna slide it, I didnt actually code for an hour I did research and reading so from now on I will be coding for an hour as well as reading for some time- I didnt read all the rules opse!*

**Today's Progress**: Been reading through the Core Java Book Vol 1 looking into arrays and into Object orientation.

**Thoughts** Improving my coding vocabulary and picking up little things that I haddent been taught.

**Extra info [Updated 11th May]** After re reading the rules and clarifying I must write code every day I will be making a GitHub Repo for the code done in this challenge and if I code in a different repo I will be linking that. 

### Day 2 11th May 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I tooka a long hard look at my code, time to refactor and delete some to make way for some new code and to make it more Spring

**Thoughts** Looking back at my code and seeing how unsustainable it was and how i had used the wrong means of controlling my application was hard, but today I did a step towards a better application, towards an application that can work on web and not be confined to discord.
